**Summary of Three Datasets: Books, Happiness, and Movies**

This summary synthesizes the insights from three datasets related to books, happiness indicators across countries, and movies. Each dataset provides a detailed overview of key attributes, descriptive statistics, correlations, and areas for improvement.

### 1. **Books Dataset (Goodreads)**

The books dataset comprises 10,000 entries containing a variety of attributes such as identifiers, author details, publication years, ratings, and reviews. 

- **Identifiers and Uniqueness**: The dataset includes identifiers like `book_id`, `goodreads_book_id`, and `isbn`, though the latter has some missing values (700 for ISBN and 585 for ISBN13), highlighting potential gaps in book categorization.
  
- **Authors and Titles**: There are 4,664 unique authors, with Stephen King being the most frequently occurring author (60 books). A total of 9,274 unique titles indicate diverse editions and versions of books.

- **Publication Year**: The average original publication year is 1982, though the data spans a wide range (from 1750 to 2017). Most books cluster around recent years, with the median year being 2004, and 75% of books published by 2011.

- **Language Distribution**: With 8,916 entries recorded and 25 unique language codes, English (`eng`) is predominant (appearing in 6,341 entries), suggesting the dataset may not fully represent global linguistic diversity.

- **Ratings and Reviews**: The average book rating is around 4.0, with a wide spread of reader engagement (from 2,716 to 4.8 million ratings). The average number of reviews is about 2,920, but a few books dominate the review counts. 

- **Correlations**: Notably, a negative correlation exists between the number of books an author publishes and the average engagement per book, suggesting that as authors publish more, individual book attention may decrease. Strong correlations also appear between high ratings (4 and 5 stars).

- **Conclusion**: The dataset provides a wealth of insights on books, including trends in publication, author popularity, and engagement metrics. However, issues such as missing ISBN values and outlier publication years need addressing to improve the dataset’s usability.

### 2. **Happiness Indicators Dataset**

This dataset includes well-being metrics across 165 countries over different years (2005-2023). Key indicators include life satisfaction (Life Ladder), GDP, social support, health expectancy, and emotional well-being.

- **Country and Year Distribution**: There are 2,363 observations from 165 countries, with Argentina being the most frequent. The average year of observation is around 2015, and there is moderate variability in the time range (standard deviation = 5.06).

- **Key Well-Being Metrics**:
  - **Life Ladder** (subjective well-being): Mean = 5.48, ranging from 1.281 to 8.019, reflecting significant variability in life satisfaction across countries.
  - **Log GDP per Capita**: Mean = 9.40, with a broad range (5.53 to 11.68), suggesting considerable economic diversity.
  - **Social Support**: Mean = 0.81, showing generally high perceived support but with some country-specific variations.
  - **Healthy Life Expectancy**: Mean = 63.4 years, with substantial variation (standard deviation = 6.84), indicating differing public health outcomes.
  - **Freedom to Make Life Choices**: Mean = 0.75, indicating a moderate sense of autonomy.
  - **Generosity and Corruption**: Generosity shows a very low mean score, while corruption perceptions show moderate variability (mean = 0.74).

- **Missing Data**: Several variables have missing values, particularly for GDP (28 missing), social support (13), healthy life expectancy (63), and generosity (81). These gaps could affect deeper analysis.

- **Correlations**:
  - **Life Ladder and GDP**: A strong positive correlation (0.78) indicates wealthier countries tend to report higher life satisfaction.
  - **Health and Wealth**: Both GDP and Life Ladder correlate strongly with health outcomes, suggesting a link between economic performance and well-being.
  - **Social Support**: Correlates positively with life satisfaction (0.72) and health expectancy (0.60).
  - **Generosity and Life Ladder**: Only a weak correlation (0.18), suggesting generosity may not be a strong driver of life satisfaction.
  - **Corruption and Life Ladder**: A negative correlation (-0.43), suggesting that higher perceived corruption is linked to lower well-being.

- **Conclusion**: The dataset reveals important insights into the relationships between economic factors, social support, health, and well-being. Missing data is an issue, but overall, the correlations highlight how economic and health metrics influence happiness. Addressing missing values is crucial for better policy analysis.

### 3. **Movies Dataset (Media)**

This dataset contains information about 2,652 movies, including attributes like release dates, languages, types, creators, and ratings.

- **Release Dates**: Of 2,653 date records, 2,055 are unique. The entry for "21-May-06" appears 8 times, suggesting potential data redundancy. There are also 99 missing date entries, which may hinder analysis if not addressed.

- **Languages**: The dataset includes 2,652 entries with 11 unique languages, and English is the most common (49%). No missing values in this column suggest completeness in language data.

- **Types and Titles**: The majority of entries are classified as "movies" (2,211), and the dataset contains 2,312 unique titles. No missing values were found in the titles.

- **Creators/Actors**: There are 2,390 records with 1,528 unique creators. Kiefer Sutherland appears most frequently (48 times). However, there are 262 missing values in this field, which could be improved.

- **Ratings**: The average overall rating is 3.05, with low variability (standard deviation = 0.76). The quality ratings have a slightly higher mean (3.21) and some variability (standard deviation = 0.80), suggesting more differentiation in perceived movie quality.

- **Repeatability**: The mean repeatability score is 1.49, indicating that most movies are not frequently revisited. The standard deviation (0.60) shows moderate variation.

- **Correlations**:
  - **Overall vs. Quality Ratings**: A strong positive correlation (0.83) suggests that higher-rated movies are generally perceived as higher quality.
  - **Overall vs. Repeatability**: A moderate correlation (0.51) suggests some connection between movie ratings and repeat viewership.
  - **Quality vs. Repeatability**: A weaker correlation (0.31) implies that repeat viewership may be influenced by factors beyond just movie quality.

- **Conclusion**: The movies dataset reveals key trends in ratings, repeatability, and the frequency of creators. However, missing data, particularly in dates and creators, limits the ability to fully analyze movie trends. Addressing these gaps and refining data processing would enhance insights into audience preferences and movie performance.

### **Final Remarks**

The three datasets—Books, Happiness, and Movies—offer rich insights into their respective domains, but all exhibit areas where data cleaning and imputation could significantly enhance the robustness of the analysis. While correlations provide valuable relationships between various attributes (e.g., happiness and GDP, movie quality and ratings), missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in certain fields need to be addressed for more reliable conclusions and better decision-making.
